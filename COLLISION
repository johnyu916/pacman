The basic challenge is to find what happened during the past delta.

What is the best way to do collision?

- based on force during the past delta, update the acceleration and the velocity, and determine the distance to move.
- move as much as you can:
    try colliding with all objects and see if you'll hit anything.
    if collided, stop moving.


- find all forces that are acting on the thing, for everything.
   - inner force 
   - frictional force
   - force from other objects

- find the highest point in some direction.
